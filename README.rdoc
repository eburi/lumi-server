= libbeat

This is libbeat, a lightweight beat detection library. It currently features alsa input and uses fftw[http://www.fftw.org/] to process the samples. It uses some Qt4-proprietary technology like timers and Qthread. These are currently a dependecy.

The software is still in development and pre-alpha.

== Sample Application

The library comes with a sample Qt Application, simply run

	qmake
	make

to build it.

Make sure you have fftw3, alsa (or PulseAudio) and Qt4 installed!
