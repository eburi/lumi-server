= libbeat

This is libbeat, a lightweight beat detection library for Qt. It currently supports ALSA[http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Main_Page] and PulseAudio[http://www.pulseaudio.org/]. It uses fftw[http://www.fftw.org/] to process the samples.

Only tested on Linux.

The software is still in development and pre-alpha.

== Sample Application

The library comes with a sample Qt Application, simply run

	qmake
	make

to build it.

Make sure you have fftw3, alsa (or PulseAudio) and Qt4 installed!
